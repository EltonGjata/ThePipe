INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
==============================================

--	Run the PipeInstaller.exe.
	This installer can install ThePipe plugins/extensions for Revit 2017, Dynamo 9x, Rhinoceros 5 and Grasshopper 5.
	You can decide which of these extensions by responding to the command line prompts with a y/n response.

--	For some of these applications, the setup files need to be copied to specific locations for them to work properly.
	For example, the Grasshopper assembly and its dependencies must be placed in the Grasshopper Libraries folder and
	the Addin manifest for the Revit addin must be in the correct folder. The Installer will show you these paths before
	copying the files and ask for your confirmation. If the paths are correct, confirm by typing 'y' and pressing return.
	If the paths are not correct for your machine, then type the correct path in each case and press return, the files
	will be copied to those paths instead.

--	NOTE: The Installer doesn't finish the installation of Rhinoceros plugin, you have to load the plugin from the
	installation path, using Rhino's PluginManager to finish installation. And for the Dynamo Library for ThePipe,
	You have to load the library (PipeForDynamo.dll in C:\ProgramData\RanjeethMahankali\PipeForDynamo folder) through
	File > Import Library in Dynamo.

--	If the installation fails fro some reason. Below are the instructions for manual installation.
